It is important to note that these rules apply to both controllers and processors -- meaning 'clouds' will not be exempt from GDPR enforcement."],"selection_policy":"sequential"}},"parent":null,"context":null,"created":"2018-01-09T21:41:44.613Z","updated":"2018-01-09T21:41:44.613Z","metadata":null,"next_step":null,"conditions":"#penalties","description":null,"dialog_node":"Penalties","previous_sibling":"Children"},{"type":"standard","title":null,"output":{"text":{"values":["Yes - GDPR is very complicated."],"selection_policy":"sequential"}},"parent":null,"context":null,"created":"2018-01-09T21:41:44.613Z","updated":"2018-01-09T21:41:44.613Z","metadata":null,"next_step":{"behavior":"jump_to","selector":"body","dialog_node":"Help"},"conditions":"#complicated","description":null,"dialog_node":"Complicated","previous_sibling":"Help"},{"type":"standard","title":null,"output":{"text":{"values":["Parental consent will be required to process the personal data of children under the age of 16 for online services; member states may legislate for a lower age of consent but this will not be below the age of 13."],"selection_policy":"sequential"}},"parent":null,"context":null,"created":"2018-01-09T21:41:44.613Z","updated":"2018-01-09T21:41:44.613Z","metadata":null,"next_step":null,"conditions":"#children","description":null,"dialog_node":"Children","previous_sibling":"Brexit"},{"type":"standard","title":null,"output":{"text":{"values":["A Data Controller is the entity that determines the purposes, conditions and means of the processing of personal data, while the Data Processor is an entity which processes personal data on behalf of the controller."],"selection_policy":"sequential"}},"parent":null,"context":null,"created":"2018-01-09T21:41:44.613Z","updated":"2018-01-09T21:41:44.613Z","metadata":null,"next_step":null,"conditions":"#understand_roles","description":null,"dialog_node":"Understand_Roles","previous_sibling":"Consent"},{"type":"standard","title":null,"output":{},"parent":null,"context":null,"created":"2018-01-09T21:41:44.613Z","updated":"2018-01-09T21:41:44.613Z","metadata":null,"next_step":{"behavior":"jump_to","selector":"body","dialog_node":"Which_Country"},"conditions":"#help","description":null,"dialog_node":"Help","previous_sibling":"Welcome"},{"type":"standard","title":null,"output":{"text":{"values":["Data subjects, people whose personal data is stored, have new mandatory rights which give them more control over their personal data.
